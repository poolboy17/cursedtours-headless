## Phase 0 Rules (LOCKED)

### Rule 1: Primary Category = City Only
Every post receives exactly ONE category, and that category is a **city/location**.

Examples of valid categories:
- New Orleans
- London

### Rule 2: Exactly One City Per Product
No post may belong to multiple city categories. If a tour spans multiple cities, use the **departure city** or **primary destination**.

### Rule 3: Topic Terms Are NOT Categories
The following are **tags or search metadata**, NOT categories:
- Cemetery, Graveyard
- Ghost, Haunted, Paranormal
- Crime, Murder, True Crime
- Witch, Voodoo, Occult
- Prison, Jail, Asylum
- Castle, Mansion, Estate
- War, Battlefield, WWII
- Underground, Catacombs

These may be used for filtering/search but NEVER as WordPress categories.

### Rule 4: No New Content May Use Old Categories
Effective immediately, all new post imports must be assigned to a **city category**.

Prohibited for new content:
- Historical Hauntings (ID: 378)
- Ghost Tours (if exists)
- Any topic-based category

### Rule 5: "Historical Hauntings" Is Frozen
- No new posts may be added to Historical Hauntings (ID: 378)
